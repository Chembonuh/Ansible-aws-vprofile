Determining the taint status of a running kernel.

The taint status of a running kernel can be determined by running

cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted

When the output is 0, the kernel is not tainted, when the output is non-zero, the kernel is tainted.

The value will be a combined number of all applying kernel taint flags added (ORed) together. You can find a list of currently used kernel flags under:
